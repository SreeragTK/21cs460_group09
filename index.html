<li><h2> <b> Project Proposal </b></h2> <br>

<h3> <b> Introduction </b> </h3>

<p> 
Solar cells are the future of energy, existing technology is based on silicon or germanium the so-called conventional semiconductors. They are
very hard to manufacture as well as it's very expensive to fabricate. Perovskite can replace this if we use 
Perovskite instead of conventional semiconductors, it'll drastically reduce the effort for making solar cells.
</p>



<p> The Perovskites are crystals with a specific crystal structure given by, <br>$$ ABX_{3} $$<br>
<img src ="imgp.png" class="center" style="width:500px;height:300px;"><br> A & B are cations, and 
X is an anion. So, we can see that there can be an enormous number of combinations which yields a Perovskite crystal,
but it's impossible to try all these combinations are get the properties that we need.
</p>

<p> In this project, we are concentrating on bandgap energy denoted by <i> Eg </i>, which determines the efficiency 
of the solar cell, and the color of light emitted if used as a LED. We also want to find a substitute of Lead (Pb),
which is the B cation in most of the Perovskites we are using today. I think I don't need to explain why because we all
know that Pb is a heavy metal and the environmental issues it causes. On a side note, from the Perovskite solar cells,
the Pb which reaches the ground is not at all significant it's similar to how much Pb we will get exposed if we are
walking on an asphalt road barefoot. Hence finding Pb-free Perovskite is not an immediate goal.
</p>



<h3> <b> Goals  </b></h3>

Our main objective is <u>to find the best possible combination of materials that makes a better
candidate for a Perovskite based solar cell or a LED </u>. For this project, we are only concentrating on the solar
cell, if time permits we'll also work on the LED. To attain the main goal we have to complete 
some milestones which are listed below,
<ol>
<li> Make a big enough data set by going through literature and the data used in some of the references (data set consists of properties of elements and <i>Eg</i> will
be the label
<li> Find out which features to use. (feature engineering)
<li> Train the machine to predict the label, which is <i>Eg</i>. (Neural Network and Linear regression)
<li> Then try all possible combinations and come up with the closest to the desired value of <i>Eg</i>
</ol>

<p> <b>By midway we are hoping we will be able to start on woking on training the machine to
perdict the <i>Eg</i> </b> </p>

<li><h4><b> Bandgap tuning strategy by Cations and Halide ions of Lead halide perovskites
 learned from Machine learning </b></h4>
<p>Bandgap engineering or obtaining a material with desired bandgap value is a crucial step to
 obtain pervoskite solar cells, which are stable and highly efficient. Here, in this paper by
 Yaogao LI, Yao Lu and their group, they are proposing a way to use Machine Learing as tool
 to determine how does the bandgap of the material is dependent on the composition of the
 material thereby predict the composition of the material with desired bandgap value. 
They used experimental datas of bandgaps of various compositions of perovskite crystals as
 the training set for their ML algorithms and used linear regression and neural networks to
 predict the bandgap values the test dataset. The class of perovskite crystal they 
considered in their work Mixed Lead halide perovskites(APbX3, A is the cation, X is the
 halide ion) and the reason for considering them in particular is their unique optical,
 electrical and properties. By varying the composition of these crystals they have obtained the
data of perovskites with bandgap values ranging from 1.5 to 3.2 eV. Here the different
 compositions of perovskite crystals are made by varying the compositions of the
cations(A) and anions(X) keeping the Lead composition fixed. Here for the cations(A),
 they used Ca(Cesium), FA(formamidinium), MA(methylammonium) and for the anions(here halides)
,they used Cl, Br and I. The dataset of past reported experiments covers a large range of 
compositions of perovskites, including pure Cl, pure Br, pure I, Br-I and Cl-Br mixed, 
aiming to get a deep and correct relation among the composition of the lead halide
perovskite and its bandgap. The dataset they used contains more than 300 data points,
 which covers more than 120 recently published research papers. Then for further 
increasing the accuracy of their model, they screened their dataset reasonably. 
In the screaning process they removed the duplicate datas present in the dataset and for 
different experimental datas of the perovskite of same composition they considered only the
 most frequently and recently reported experimental data.  
After this screening process, the final dataset they obtained contained 109 datapoints. 
Among this final dataset the maximum bandgap obtained was 3.16 eV for MAPbCl3 and minimum 
bandgap obtained was 1.48 eV, which was for FAPbI3. </p>

<h5><b> Application of different ML algorithms </b></h5>
They used three different ML algorithms to study about the correlation between bandgap
energy and the composition of the perovskite crystal. They are linear regression(LR),
 neural network(NN) and random forest(RF).  They chose ratios of Cs,FA,Cl and Br in the
 perovskite crystal with formula CsaFAbMA(1−a−b)Pb(ClxBryI(1−x−y))3, as input features for
 their models. So in total they had 4 input features and their output was the bandgap 
value of the perovskite. For training and testing purpose they divided the data randomly
 into 5 parts in which the the 4 parts(80%) were assigned for training and the remaining 1 
part(20%) was assigned for testing. Then for checking the performance and accuracy of
 their algorithms, they evaluated root mean square error(RMSE) and Pearson correlation on
 their models. For all models, they obtained low RMSE values, indicating their high accuracy
 in prediction and obtained high Pearson correlation(r value), which indicates that the 
predicted values and the experimental values have strong correlation. Among the three 
algorithms performance was maximum with LR and NN because of their low RMSE value as 
compared to the RMSE value obtained from RF. And LR algorithm had an additional advantage 
that they can be used to manually predict the bandgap of a perovskite crystal with unknown
 composition and the model they obtained for that manual prediction purpose was(using LR),
For perovskite with the formula of CsaFAbMA(1−a−b)Pb (ClxBryI(1−x−y))3 ,they obtained the 
Eg as,
 
$$ E_{g} = 1.587 − 0.039a − 0.102b + 1.543x + 0.669y $$




 (This model was obtained from the regression coefficients of their LR model)

<li><h4> <b> Identifying Pb-free perovskites for solar cells by machine learning </b> </h3>
<p> In this paper,  the main goal is to find the lead-free perovskites using ML Density functional
theory (DFT). We all know the harmful effects of Lead, lead is used widely in Perovskites
because of the stability and desirable bandgap of lead-based perovskites. </p>

<p> In this research article they are generating data of double perovskites, that is they 
have 2 types of atoms/molecules in B site, by first order DFT. The features are atomic properties 
like Pauling’s electronegativity, ionization potential, highest occupied atomic level, 
lowest unoccupied atomic level etc. of 540 hypothetical perovskites 
They have used decision tree-based algorithm known as Gradient boosted Regression Tree (GBRT)
, which is prone to overfitting but GBRT is prevents this by gradient boosting method.
They have also taken Heat of formation into consideration because there is a direct 
relationship between the heat of formation and the stability of the crystal</p> 

<p> Major advantages </p>
<ol>
<li> Since the data is generated using the DFT, we can train the model using a large data set
<li> We can predict non-linear relations also where Linear Regression can't do a good job 
there
</ol>

<p> The major drawbacks we face here is,</p>
<ol> 
<li> It’s very hard to get the data for organic molecules using DFT, and also the 
first order DFT is not accurate enough.
<li>  We need the bandgap to be in the range of 1.1 – 1.8 eV and that corresponds to
 approximately  0.3 - 0.8 eV an offset of 0.8 eV in the data generated. Which is less accurate that the MSE of
Linear Regression
</ol>
</ol>

<h3><b> Progress we have made untill now </b></h3>

<p> We have implimented the Linear regression on the data which have obtained from 
the <a href="https://doi.org/10.1039/D1RA03117A">Bandgap tuning strategy by cations and halide ions of lead halide perovskites learned from machine learning</a>
and implementation of ANN is almost done, both the algorithms are obtained from Scikit learn 
package. <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/12_M-Zy49UI2pQiHWhCRqpkSvKuL-ZqpP/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=106520685704296194491&rtpof=true&sd=true"> Data Set </a> <br> The results are given below </p> We started by making the correlation matrix of the
data, the plot is given below,
<img src ="corr.png" class="center" style="width:500px;height:300px;">
<ol>
<li> <h4> Results from Linear Regression </h4> 
The input features used were concentration of Cs, FA, MA, Cl, Br and I. So in total we used 6 input features and the output is the band gap energy of the crystal.
For seperating the whole data into Testing and Training, we used the ration 67:33(Train : Test). Then we obtained our result with low RMSE(Root Mean Square Error) (obtained as 0.10514968248985873 ), indicating their high accuracy in prediction and obtained high Pearson correlation (or) r value(obtained as 0.9263513280757425)which indicates that the predicted values and the experimental values have strong correlation. 
<img src ="predict.png" class="center" style="width:500px;height:300px;">
And the corresponding Regression coefficients of the features and the intercept were obtained as,
<img src ="coeff.png" class="center" style="width:400px;height:220px;">
<p>Then the final model of predicting the Bandgap energy was obtained as,
$$E_{g}  = 2.66635970285812 - 0.347986 MA - 0.429095 FA - 0.365870 Cs + 0.816619 Cl - 0.065292 Br - 0.751327 I$$
This model can be used to predict composition of Lead Halide Perovskite required to obtain a desired value of bandgap energy(within error
 limits). Now if consider an LED, this bandgap energy is the parameter which determines the wavelength of light emitted from it.
 So for that case, this model can used to predict composition of Lead Halide Perovskite which is required to make an LED which emits
 wavelength of light of our interest(The practical construction such predicted composition of Perovskite can be possible, difficult or
 in some cases even impossible. So practical construction/experimental verification is required to understand the practical feasibility of 
such model predicted by the ML algorithm) </p>

<li> <h4> Results from ANN </h4>
In this case also, we obtained our result with low RMSE(Root Mean Square Error) (obtained as 0.13380158533163938), indicating their high 
accuracy in prediction and obtained high Pearson correlation (or) r value(obtained as 0.9246494649708933) which indicates that the 
predicted values and the experimental values have strong correlation.

<h3><b> Future Plans and Improvements </b></h3>
We have used all 6 concentrations as features but, we could have reduced the features to 4, that'll be implemented soon. The major update is
 the addition data with Lead Tin mixtures at the B site which we have obtained from various literatures published, there are no published articles that we could find which has tried to find the
 bandgaps of Lead-Tin halide using experimental data. The Lead-Tin mixture has shown some interesting anomalous properties, and it deviates
 from the linear relationship, which might result in the poor performance of Linear Regression model.  And there is a good chance in the
 reduction of accuracy if consider the data as a whole, we are required to use Transductive learning here. We need to find an optimal way 
to incorporate all these data as efficient as possible. And if time permits we'll also try to include data for efficiencies of solar cells, and try to predict the same.
